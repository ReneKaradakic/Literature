  abstract  = {The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, it reviews the model of search and matching equilibrium and derives the properties of employment and unemployment equilibrium. Second, it applies the model to the study of employment fluctuations and to the explanation of differences in unemployment rates in industrialized countries. The search and matching model is built on the assumptions of a time-consuming matching technology that determines the rate of job creation given the unmatched number of workers and jobs; and on a stochastic arrival of idiosyncratic shocks that determines the rate of job destruction given the wage contract between matched firms and workers. The outcome is a model for the flow of new jobs and unemployed workers from inactivity to production (the ‘job creation’ flow) and one for the flow of workers from employment to unemployment and of jobs out of the market (the ‘job destruction’ flow). Steady-state equilibrium is at the point where the two flows are equal. The model is shown to explain well the employment fluctuations observed in the \{US\} economy, within the context of a real business cycle model. It is also shown that the large differences in unemployment rates observed in industrialized countries can be attributed to a large extent to differences in policy towards employment protection legislation (which increases the duration of unemployment and reduces the flow into unemployment) and the generosity of the welfare state (which reduces job creation). It is argued that on the whole European countries have been more generous in their unemployment support policies and in their employment protection legislation than the USA. The chapter also surveys other reasons given in the literature for the observed levels in unemployment, including mismatch and real interest rates.},

In this literature, unemployment spell and job spell durations as well as wage offers are treated as endogenous outcomes of forward looking job creation and job destruction decisions made by the workers and employers who populate the models. The solutions studied are dynamic stochastic equilibria in the sense that time and uncertainty are explicitly modeled, expectations are rational, private gains from trade are exploited, and the actions taken by all agents are mutually consistent. We argue that the framework provides a useful setting in which to study the effects of alternative wage setting institutions and different labor market policy regimes.},

  abstract    = {From 1989-2012, on average 23\% of those eligible for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits in the US did not collect them. In a search model with matching frictions, asymmetric information associated with the UI non-collectors implies an inefficiency in non-collector outcomes. This inefficiency is characterized along with the key features of collector vs. non-collector allocations. Specifically, the inefficiency implies that non-collectors transition to employment at a faster rate and a lower wage than the efficient levels. Quantitatively, the inefficiency amounts to 1.71\% welfare loss in consumption equivalent terms for the average worker, with a 3.85\% loss conditional on non-collection. With an endogenous take-up rate, the unemployment rate and average duration of unemployment respond significantly slower to changes in the UI benefit level, relative to the standard model with a 100\% take-up rate.},

Based on a simple merger simulation, we find that a merger between the top two employers in the retail industry would be most damaging, with about 24 million euros in annual lost wages for new hires, and an 8000 decrease in annual hires.},

We contribute to this debate by investigating the joint impact of parental leave and child care, using administrative data covering the labor market and birth histories of Austrian workers over more than half a century. We start by quasi-experimentally identifying the causal effects of all family policy reforms since the 1950s on the full dynamics of male and female earnings. We then map these causal estimates into a decomposition framework a la Kleven, Landais and Søgaard (2019) to compute counterfactual gender gaps. Our results show that the enormous expansions of parental leave and child care subsidies have had virtually no impact on gender convergence.},
